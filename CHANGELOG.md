## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

First public release — an early MVP. Under heavy development and not yet
production-ready.

### Added

- **Charts from CSV.** `table`, `pie`, `bar`, `map`, and `number` chart types.
  Each takes a `dataset` and `title` plus a couple of chart-specific fields, and
  renders to standalone HTML (server-rendered, htmx-only, no build step).
- **YAML dashboards.** Declare datasets, charts, and page layout in a single
  YAML file via a compact layout DSL (`["@<height>", "<chart>:<width>", ...]`,
  headers, and separators). Render with `Dashboard.from_yaml(text).to_html()`.
- **Crossfiltering.** Click a chart value and every other chart narrows to
  match, with no page reload. Fixed `filters` can also be declared per chart.
- **Browser editor.** Two-pane editor: write YAML on the left, live preview on
  the right. Add charts from a menu with a form, drag rows and columns to
  resize, move charts, and edit each chart through a modal. Every edit is
  written back as clean YAML so the visual and code views stay in sync.
- **AI assistant.** Built-in chat edits the dashboard from plain-English
  requests, validating each change before applying it. Runs on Claude; gated by
  an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and disabled gracefully when no key is set.
- **Use as a library.** `import fireflyer as ff`; charts render inline in
  Jupyter via `_repr_html_` or expose their HTML through `to_html()`.
- **Run with Docker or locally.** `docker compose up --build` for the editor
  with hot-reload, or `pip install -e ".[test]"` and `python -m fireflyer.web`.
- **Snapshot test suite.** Each test pairs an input CSV + chart/dashboard
  definition with the exact expected HTML in `tests/snapshots/`.
- **Source-available license.** Apache-2.0 with the Commons Clause.
